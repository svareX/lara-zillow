# Lara-Zillow

## About the project 
Lara-Zillow is a web application inspired by [zillow](https://www.zillow.com/). This project was my personal introduction to Single Page Application approach to creating websites. 

## Technologies used to accomplish this solution are:

 - [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
 - [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/)
 - [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/)
 - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 
## Try it yourself!
First you need to clone the repository.

    git clone https://github.com/svareX/lara-zillow

Then install all the package and dependencies.

    npm install

After that you need to setup an .env file (use the .env.example as a template)
Create your database table.

    php artisan migrate


While you have a local database server like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
Then all you need to do is to start a local Laravel server.

    php artisan serve
