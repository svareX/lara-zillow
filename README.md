# Lara-Zillow

## About the project 
Lara-Zillow is a web application inspired by [zillow](https://www.zillow.com/). This project was my personal introduction to Single Page Application approach to creating websites. I've wanted to try this more "modern" approach since it is very popular in current times and I have to say that its something completely different from the classic Blade or even Livewire approach. Project has some of the more basic functions like user registering, authenticating, authorizing using email verification. I have also implemented features such as real-time listing filtering and pagination, image uploading, full-screen image previews, offers and notifications and a real-time interest calculator. The application supports both dark and light mode depending on user's browser settings.

## Technologies used to accomplish this solution are:

 - [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
 - [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/)
 - [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/)
 - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 
## Try it yourself!
First you need to clone the repository.

    git clone https://github.com/svareX/lara-zillow

Then install all the package and dependencies.

    npm install

After that you need to setup an .env file (use the .env.example as a template)
Create your database table.

    php artisan migrate


While you have a local database server like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
Then all you need to do is to start a local Laravel server.

    php artisan serve
